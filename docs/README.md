    <h2>Revamped Job Scheduling</h2>
    <p>Reimagined task scheduling where a manager passively listen to the sealing progress of workers, which ultimately results in 30% increase of sealing efficiency</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Private SaaS</h2>
    <p>Through Damocles' original architecture and broad selection of configurations, SPs can quickly organize a pool of workers into effectively a private SaaS (sealing-as-a-service) that can be used to seal for multiple miner_ids at the same time</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Optimized Snapdeal</h2>
    <p>SP can batch import existing CC sectors as local candidate sectors. As storage deals come in, workers would go and grab candidate sectors by themselves and snap deal onto those candidate sectors minizing manual intervention</p>
